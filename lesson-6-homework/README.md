# Homework #6

## Note from Tori
---
This was a purely CSS exercise. Since I already have practice with vanilla CSS in my other projects, I did not attempt the extra credit on this assignment.

## Instructions
---
1. Fork and clone this repo.

2. Create your `index.html` file and your `styles.css` file.  Link your css file to your html file.  Open your `index.html` file in the browser.  Verify that your stylesheet is properly connected.

3. Style your `index.html` file to match `homework.png` as closely as you can.

	* You can achieve this using only `<div>` elements.
	* Flexbox makes it very simple to create layouts.  Reference the url below.

### Extra Credit

1. Add some pseudoclasses to the page to change colors as you hover over different elements.

2. Create a separate `index.html` and `styles.css` in a separate folder and do your best to copy this webpage: https://lambdaschool.com/

    * You can copy the images by right clicking and selecting "Copy Image Address".  Paste the address into an `<img>` tag's `src` attribute.
    * You can achieve translucent backgrounds with `rgba` colors. Example: `rgba(200, 200, 200, .5)` The `.5` (alpha value) controls the transparency.
