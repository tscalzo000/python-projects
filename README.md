#Python Projects

I'm learning Python through a few different avenues:
---
1. LambdaSchool's free mini online bootcamp

2. Zed Shaw's book 'Learning Python the Hard Way'

3. The Complete Python Course: Beginner to Advanced by Joseph Delgadillo

This repository holds the project files for these and I'll be adding to it as I work through the courses.
